# whatsforlunch

A Python and JavaScript-based full-stack web application to make food decision making easier! ðŸ¥—ðŸ’­

## Description
Do you and your friends have trouble finding a place to eat? let whatsforlunch do the work! whatsforlunch asks for 1 preference keyword and your zip code to query Yelp's Fusion API and find you a random restaurant in your area to make the choice easy and expose you to new local restaurants.

## How it was built
whatsforlunch was built with a Python backend using the Flask framework, HTML/CSS for frontend, and JavaScript with the JQuery library for both frontend and backend. The Yelp Fusion API was used to query restaurant data and the Google Location API was used to convert zip code information into latitude/longitude information.

Python, Javascript, Flask, Yelp Fusion API, Google location API, HTML/CSS 
API authorization keys removed from code for both APIs
